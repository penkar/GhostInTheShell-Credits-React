# GhostInTheShell-Credits-React
Ghost in the Shell 1995 opening credits screen transitions.

Application is built in React, Babel and Flow.

[Example](http://jspenkar.com/GhostInTheShell-Credits-React/)

Accepts a list of paramaters that will change the defaults for size and color, and some other limited functionality.

Accepts an array of strings that will eventually be faded into.


Similar to the credits transition in the 1995 Ghost in the Shell movie ([opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsiepGvjjTM)).

Work in progress. I'm still in the process of refactoring this, and making it a bit more modular.
